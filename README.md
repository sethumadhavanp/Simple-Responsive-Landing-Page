# Landing-Page

## ðŸŽ“ What I Learned by Doing This
By creating this simple responsive landing page using HTML and CSS, I learned several important web development concepts and skills:

âœ… 1. How to Structure a Webpage with HTML
I learned how to create a basic HTML5 document, organize content using semantic tags like <header>, <section>, and <footer>, and link an external CSS file to style the page.

âœ… 2. How to Style a Page with CSS
I practiced using CSS to control the appearance of the webpage â€” including setting colors, fonts, spacing, and layout. I also applied modern styling techniques like gradients, hover effects, and rounded buttons.

âœ… 3. Using Flexbox for Layout
I used CSS Flexbox to create flexible layouts that adjust properly across screen sizes. This helped in aligning navigation links, centering hero content, and organizing footer items.

âœ… 4. Making the Page Responsive with Media Queries
I learned how to make the layout mobile-friendly using media queries. This allowed the navigation menu to collapse into a hamburger icon on smaller screens, making the site usable on phones and tablets.

âœ… 5. Adding Interactivity with JavaScript
I added a small JavaScript snippet to toggle the mobile navigation menu. This gave me experience with basic DOM manipulation and event handling.

âœ… 6. Designing a User-Friendly Interface
I understood the importance of clean, consistent design â€” using color themes (blue), readable fonts, simple icons, and well-spaced sections to make the page visually appealing and easy to navigate.

âœ… 7. Organizing Code with Classes and Containers
I learned how to use utility classes and a container layout to keep the structure neat, reusable, and easy to maintain across the site.
